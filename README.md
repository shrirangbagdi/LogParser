## 1. Description of Parser

It is difficult to read through hundreds of lines of errors, warnings, information, etc. in order to understand what may be happening. This open source log parsing project was created 
in order to aid in parsing such logs.


## 2. Possible Commands

In order to run this parser properly, you will have to make sure that you run the commands properly. For now there are six possible commands. In order to run these commands properly, you must update the 
source pathway to include a folder as well as a destination pathway inside the property file. You must additionally read the [LogParser.properties](https://github.com/shrirangbagdi/LogParser/blob/master/LogParser.properties) file descriptions. It contains a list of possible commands that this parser can complete. For example, 
in order to run a file parser the user must include the command number as well as the file in the folder that they want to parse through.


## 3. Necessary Libraries
The user must make sure to have the latest version of python installed as well as boto3.
