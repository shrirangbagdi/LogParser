## 1. Description of Parser

It is difficult to read through hundreds of lines of errors, warnings, information, etc. in order to understand what may be going wrong with an application. This open source log parsing project was created in order to aid in parsing such logs in order to find error and warningÂ messages and to generate a detailed output file.

### Different Implementations:

#### Log Parser using AWS Lambda Function
When a user uploads log files into an S3 Bucket, an AWS lambda function is triggered. The AWS Lambda function parses through all the input files and generates a JSON file of messages. The generated output is uploaded into another S3 bucket.

#### Log Parser for an S3 Bucket without AWS Lambda
If one wants to just generate a JSON file without using the AWS lambda trigger, there is also an implementation that allows the user to generate JSON files through the parsing of the S3 Bucket. 

#### Log Parser for a file through the command line 
If one wants to just generate a JSON file by specificing the pathway of the log file there is also an implementation for that to aid the user in generating JSON files. 


## 2. Possible Commands

If the program is run using the command line, there are 6 possible commands that the user can run. In order to run these commands properly, you must update the 
source pathway and destination pathway inside the property file. You must additionally read the [LogParser.properties](https://github.com/shrirangbagdi/LogParser/blob/master/LogParser.properties) file for more information. It contains a list of possible commands that this parser can complete. For example, in order to run a file parser the user must include the command number as well as the file in the folder that they want to parse through.


## 3. Setup

For all setup options make sure that python3 is installed. Additionally, for all implementations of the LogParser the different pattern classes are necessary in order for the program to run. 
If you are using the LogParser with the S3 Bucket without AWS Lambda make sure to have Boto3 installed. 
If you are using the LogParser for a file through the command line make sure that the source pathway and destination pathway is updated inside the property file. You must additionally read the [LogParser.properties](https://github.com/shrirangbagdi/LogParser/blob/master/LogParser.properties) file for more information.
